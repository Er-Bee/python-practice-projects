note to self: if you want to save every usable character
and then randomly pick, import string for easy access to 
lower / upper and digits instead of what i did.
what i did is:
33 - 47 (including) are symbols
58 - 64 (including) are more symbols
91 - 96 (including) are more more symbols
48 - 57 (including) are digits
65 - 90 (including) are uppercase letters
97 - 122 (including) are lowercase letters
